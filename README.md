# Welcome

Hi, I am Dean, a full-stack software engineer who specializes in designing, implementing, testing, and maintaining scalable web applications. I also work as a freelancer on different projects and I like to contribute to open source communities. All my public repositories are free resources that I developed over time for fun or as a utility to another project. I don't actively maintain any of them.
